# üìä Life Expectancy Analysis with Spatial Data and Machine Learning  

## üìñ Introduction  
Life expectancy is a crucial indicator of population health and socio-economic development. However, it varies significantly across regions, often due to geographic factors such as healthcare access, environmental quality, and economic conditions. This project explores life expectancy using **spatial data analysis** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to uncover geographical patterns and improve predictive modeling.  

By incorporating spatial context into our models, we aim to achieve a deeper understanding of life expectancy determinants and improve predictions compared to traditional non-spatial approaches. These insights can help identify critical areas for public health intervention.
